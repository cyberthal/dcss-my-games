 10712 | D:8      | Reached skill level 5 in Spellcasting
 10713 | D:8      | cleaner hippogriff kill that time
 10807 | D:8      | dagger is better for applying confusing touch.  it already
                  | gets a to-hit bonus.  swing speed matters.
 10928 | D:7      | oops, should've done that on a stair
 11512 | D:8      | should I learn shock?  sometimes useful... spell levels are
                  | scarce.
 11512 | D:8      | wouldn't be missing anything castable.  might want heavier
                  | armor anyway
 11512 | D:8      | MP scarce too.  but shock is good for tunnel rushes.
 11514 | D:8      | Learned a level 1 spell: Shock
 11705 | D:9      | Reached *** piety under Cheibriados
 11876 | D:9      | oops
 12120 | D:9      | Found a staircase to the Lair.
 12153 | D:9      | Noticed a death yak
 12154 | D:9      | uh oh
 12183 | D:9      | yeah, didn't think I could take him, but wanted to feel him
                  | out
 12184 | D:9      | cost me a blink and ?2 tele
 12290 | D:9      | this is why early lair is a bad idea for NaVM
 12290 | D:9      | I have no clue how to kill this thing
 12305 | D:9      | death yaks man
 12329 | D:9      | Reached skill level 5 in Fighting
 12659 | D:9      | all I can do is flee the floor
 12660 | D:10     | Entered Level 10 of the Dungeon
 12897 | D:10     | I pushed further with that Death Yak to confirm that I was
                  | truly stymied.  Rarely happens for an essential build.  But
                  | there you have it.
 12919 | D:10     | Noticed a two-headed ogre
 12934 | D:10     | Killed a two-headed ogre
 13167 | D:10     | there's some GDR finally from the steam dragon scales
 13167 | D:10     | not a shield, but it'll help
 13614 | D:10     | hm, that acrobat amulet is tempting
 13614 | D:10     | this isn't working. may as well try it
 13614 | D:10     | or I could just spam bend space more.
 13614 | D:10     | no I want the reposition for mephitic etc
 13614 | D:10     | maybe the problem is an unwillingness to blitz with
                  | olgreb's
 13614 | D:10     | on tough single targets
 13614 | D:10     | try this way a little longer?
 13614 | D:10     | it should be viable both ways
 13702 | D:10     | Noticed an unseen horror
 13705 | D:10     | faith means spamming abilities
 13723 | D:10     | Killed an unseen horror
 13723 | D:10     | Reached skill level 10 in Poison Magic
 13723 | D:10     | Reached XP level 11. HP: 69/94 MP: 12/18
 13816 | D:10     | Got a bloodstained dagger
 13902 | D:10     | do I care about disto at this point?
 13902 | D:10     | it'd be an answer to the death yaks
 13902 | D:10     | Identified the +11 dagger of Reinforcement {pierce, *Contam
                  | rElec rN++ Str+2} (You found it on level 10 of the Dungeon)
 13903 | D:10     | hm
 13903 | D:10     | can at least try it
 13905 | D:10     | no good vs hydras
 14092 | D:10     | Reached **** piety under Cheibriados
 14165 | D:10     | that's a hydra vault, better not enter
 14640 | D:11     | this doesn't work too well
 14684 | D:11     | that was little better.  maybe the dagger was working for
                  | me.
 14932 | D:11     | Found a staircase to the Orcish Mines.
 15073 | D:11     | Noticed a cyclops
 15098 | D:11     | Killed a cyclops
 15234 | D:11     | this glass cannon experience is unpleasant
 15234 | D:11     | defenses are this character's weakness
 15234 | D:11     | i'll try the acrobat amulet
 15490 | D:11     | yeah this feels much better already.  moving isn't
                  | terrifying
 16013 | D:11     | oops
 16237 | Orc:1    | Entered Level 1 of the Orcish Mines
 16238 | Orc:1    | draining might help vs death yaks
 16248 | Orc:1    | Reached skill level 1 in Armour
 16260 | D:11     | massacred orc entrance until OOM.  now rotate stairs
 16310 | D:12     | yeah this is better than the faith amulet.  needed defenses
 16330 | D:12     | Noticed a cyclops
 16334 | D:12     | yeah draining is key to this build
 16334 | D:12     | and orc is a good source!
 16354 | D:12     | Killed a cyclops
 16458 | D:11     | finally troll leather armor.
 16458 | D:11     | armor skill won't do much for me
 16458 | D:11     | no change
 16571 | D:12     | Noticed Frances
 16574 | D:12     | Noticed a soul eater
 16582 | D:12     | Killed Frances
 16582 | D:12     | Reached skill level 10 in Stealth
 16727 | D:12     | whoah, I missed the Dex stat boost.  Dodging should be
                  | primary now.
 16727 | D:12     | that explains why I couldn't handle the Death Yaks, I bet
 16727 | D:12     | although I didn't have a decent heavier armor to wear?
 16727 | D:12     | maybe the +2 ring mail
 16727 | D:12     | anyway Lair is still bad for naga
 16787 | D:12     | Noticed Jorgrun
 16787 | D:12     | forgot i was only supposed to be stairdancing this floor
                  | while also breaching orc.  oops
 16810 | D:12     | Killed Jorgrun
 16810 | D:12     | Reached skill level 5 in Air Magic

 17074 | Orc:1    | Reached ***** piety under Cheibriados
 17335 | D:12     | Got an ancient falchion
 17413 | D:12     | Noticed Snorg
 17414 | D:12     | debuff snorg first
 17415 | D:12     | or that could happen
 17415 | D:12     | should've opened with curare. sigh
 17425 | D:12     | Killed Snorg
 17425 | D:12     | Reached skill level 11 in Poison Magic
 17473 | Orc:1    | tada!  orc breached
 17486 | Orc:1    | Reached skill level 5 in Dodging
 17542 | Orc:1    | draining!  now I have a chance against death yaks
 17626 | Orc:1    | Noticed an ettin
 17638 | Orc:1    | Killed an ettin
 17639 | Orc:1    | Noticed an orc warlord
 17645 | Orc:1    | chei piety is meant to be spent for the retreat, slouching
                  | away
 17646 | Orc:1    | this might be it
 17735 | D:11     | well that went poorly
 17750 | Orc:1    | I stayed in too long against the flood, forgetting
                  | inability to retreat
 17750 | Orc:1    | Lost mutation: You tend to lose your temper in combat.
                  | [potion of mutation]
 17750 | Orc:1    | Lost mutation: You are surrounded by a mild repulsion
                  | field. (EV +2) [potion of mutation]
 17750 | Orc:1    | Gained mutation: Your magical capacity is low. (-10% MP)
                  | [potion of mutation]
 17750 | Orc:1    | Gained mutation: You are resistant to hostile enchantments.
                  | (MR+) [potion of mutation]
 17750 | Orc:1    | Gained mutation: You are partially covered in slimy green
                  | scales. (AC +2) [potion of mutation]
 17751 | Orc:1    | not bad mut
 17752 | Orc:1    | this has gone much rougher than usual.  one of my worst
                  | NaVM runs, and I didn't practice orc
 17763 | D:11     | draining is just perfect for NaVM, especially with
                  | Confusing Touch
 17842 | D:11     | Killed an orc warlord
 18058 | D:11     | so I've played this poorly.  obviously my guide was
                  | incomplete.  I'll have to revise.  this was a learning
                  | demo, usually they're elite demos.
 18058 | D:11     | you can tell by the consumable attrition and all the
                  | redzones
 18255 | Orc:1    | anyway I reckon that's enough
 18255 | Orc:1    | maybe take on the death yak
 18430 | D:7      | Bought a scroll of teleportation for 69 gold pieces
 18430 | D:7      | Bought a scroll of teleportation for 69 gold pieces
 18579 | D:9      | protection brand is also OP on NaVM, especially with solid
                  | GDR!
 18796 | D:9      | Noticed a two-headed ogre
 18808 | D:9      | oops, was supposed to activate protection first
 18815 | D:9      | Killed a two-headed ogre
 18815 | D:9      | Gained mutation: You can use your snake-like lower body to
                  | constrict enemies. [Naga growth]
 18815 | D:9      | Reached XP level 13. HP: 85/117 MP: 10/19
 18961 | D:9      | Noticed Prince Ribbit
 18973 | D:9      | Killed Prince Ribbit
 18974 | D:9      | kek
 19115 | D:11     | Identified the +2 falchion of Truth {antimagic, rElec} (You
                  | found it on level 12 of the Dungeon)
 19116 | D:11     | with constriction, lair is much easier now.  just need a
                  | hydra answer
 19316 | D:9      | no problem
 19452 | D:9      | Found an iron altar of Okawaru.
 19453 | D:9      | still no hydra solution.  otherwise the character is
                  | well-established.  good enough!
 19453 | D:9      | Quit the game
